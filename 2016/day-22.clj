;; Determined the solution by printing the map and counting:

;; x28-y20 is empty to start
;; goal node is x31-y0, 64T
;; destination is 0 0
;; moving the space left to x=25 takes 3 steps
;; moving the space up to y=0 takes 20 steps
;; moving to x30 takes 5 steps
;; it takes 5 steps to move the goal data one to the left
;; moving it to x=1 takes 5 * 30 = 150 steps
;; it takes one step to move it to x=0
;; (+ 3 20 5 150 1)
;; => 173 Wrong! too low. we need to avoid a line of large nodes.
;; => 179



;; Moving to the left takes 1 step, plus 4 steps
